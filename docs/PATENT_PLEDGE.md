##  Defensive Patent Pledge

To encourage broad adoption and innovation around the Corpus Protocol Suite, **Interoperable Intelligence Inc.** makes the following defensive patent pledge:

### Patent Non-Assertion Pledge
**We pledge not to assert our patents against you for implementing the Corpus Protocol specifications**, except in defensive counterclaims.

More specifically:

1. **Covered Activities**
   - Implementing the Corpus Protocol specifications as described in `docs/spec/`
   - Building adapters, clients, servers, or tools that comply with the protocol
   - Using, modifying, or distributing software under the Apache 2.0 license

2. **Defensive Suspension**
   This pledge is suspended with respect to any entity that:
   - Asserts any patent against Interoperable Intelligence Inc. or its affiliates
   - Asserts any patent against any user, distributor, or implementer of the Corpus Protocol
   - Challenges the validity of any Interoperable Intelligence Inc. patent in a proceeding

3. **Scope & Limitations**
   - This pledge applies only to patents owned or controlled by Interoperable Intelligence Inc.
   - It does not apply to trademarks, service marks, or certification marks
   - It does not grant rights beyond those in the Apache 2.0 license for the Software
   - Interoperable Intelligence Inc. reserves the right to terminate this pledge with 90 days' written notice

4. **Definitions**
   - **"Implementing"** means creating software that adheres to the protocol specifications
   - **"Defensive counterclaim"** means asserting patents only as a counterclaim in response to being sued first
   - **"Corpus Protocol specifications"** means the documents in `docs/spec/` and their successors

### Why We Make This Pledge
We believe that:
- **Protocols should be open** and free from patent fear
- **Innovation thrives** when developers can build without legal uncertainty
- **The ecosystem grows** when patents protect, not threaten, the community
- **Interoperability requires trust** – we're building bridges, not walls

### Legal Effect
This pledge is a commitment by **Interoperable Intelligence Inc.** It supplements but does not replace the Apache 2.0 license or any Commercial License. For legal certainty, parties may request a signed patent non-assertion covenant from the Company.
