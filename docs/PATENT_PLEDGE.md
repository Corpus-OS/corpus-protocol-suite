##  Defensive Patent Pledge

To encourage broad adoption and innovation around the Corpus Protocol Suite, **Interoperable Intelligence Inc.** makes the following defensive patent pledge:

### Patent Non-Assertion Pledge
**We pledge not to assert our patents against you for implementing the Corpus Protocol specifications**, except in defensive counterclaims.

More specifically:

1. **Covered Activities**
   - Implementing the Corpus Protocol specifications as described in `docs/spec/`
   - Building adapters, clients, servers, or tools that comply with the protocol
   - Using, modifying, or distributing software under the Apache 2.0 license
   
   **1.5 Essential Patent Claims**
   
   This pledge applies only to patent claims that are **necessarily infringed by conformant implementation** of the Corpus Protocol specifications as published in `docs/spec/`.
   
   **Covered (Essential Claims):**
   - Patents covering protocol message formats, routing mechanisms, interface definitions, and other elements required for compliant implementation
   - Patent claims where there is no technically feasible alternative to implement the specification without infringement
   
   **Not Covered (Non-Essential Claims):**
   - Patents on optional features, optimizations, or extensions beyond the specifications
   - Patents on technologies that use or integrate with Corpus Protocol but are not required for protocol compliance
   - Patents on products, services, algorithms, or implementations independent of protocol conformance
   - Patents unrelated to protocol implementation or interoperability
   - Implementation choices where technically feasible alternatives exist
   
   **Clarifying Example:** If you build a Corpus-compatible API gateway (covered under this pledge) and also develop a proprietary ensemble optimization algorithm (not covered), this pledge protects your gateway's protocol implementation but does not prevent patent enforcement on the separate optimization technology.

2. **Defensive Suspension**
   This pledge is suspended with respect to any entity that:
   - Asserts any patent against Interoperable Intelligence Inc. or its affiliates
   - Asserts any patent **related to protocol implementation, interoperability, or AI infrastructure** against any user, distributor, or implementer of the Corpus Protocol
   - Challenges the validity of any Interoperable Intelligence Inc. patent in a proceeding

3. **Scope & Limitations**
   - This pledge applies only to patents owned or controlled by Interoperable Intelligence Inc.
   - It does not apply to trademarks, service marks, or certification marks
   - It does not grant rights beyond those in the Apache 2.0 license for the Software
   
   **3.5 Patent Coverage**
   - This pledge covers all patents and patent applications owned by Interoperable Intelligence Inc. as of the effective date
   - For patents acquired after this date, coverage begins 30 days after acquisition
   - "Controlled" means patents where we have the right to grant non-assertion covenants without third-party consent
   
   **3.6 Geographic Scope**
   - This pledge applies to all patents owned by Interoperable Intelligence Inc. in all jurisdictions
   - Where local law requires specific formalities, parties may request jurisdiction-specific covenants
   
   **3.7 Termination and Grandfathering**
   - Interoperable Intelligence Inc. may terminate this pledge with 90 days' written notice via public announcement at corpus.io/patents
   - Termination does not affect implementations created or deployed before the termination effective date
   - Entities in good standing at termination retain pledge benefits for their existing implementations indefinitely
   - "Written notice" means public posting plus email notification to any parties who have requested signed covenants

4. **Definitions**
   - **"Implementing"** means creating software that adheres to the protocol specifications
   - **"Essential Patent Claims"** means patent claims that are necessarily infringed by any conformant implementation of the Corpus Protocol specifications, where no technically feasible alternative exists
   - **"Defensive counterclaim"** means asserting patents only as a counterclaim in response to being sued first, specifically for patents covering the Corpus Protocol specifications or related to its implementation
   - **"Corpus Protocol specifications"** means the officially designated and versioned documents published by Interoperable Intelligence Inc. in `docs/spec/` and their authorized successors
   - **"Related to protocol implementation"** means patents covering protocol interfaces, interoperability patterns, or AI infrastructure directly relevant to Corpus Protocol implementation
   - **"Conformant implementation"** means implementation that complies with the mandatory requirements specified in `docs/spec/` without requiring use of optional features or extensions

### Certification Without Trademark Conflict
While our trademarks remain protected, any implementation that passes our conformance tests (Platinum/Gold/Silver) may state:
- ✅ "Implements Corpus Protocol v1 specification"
- ✅ "Corpus Protocol compatible"

But may not claim without authorization:
- ⚠️ "Official Corpus implementation"
- ⚠️ "Certified by Corpus" (requires certification agreement)
- ⚠️ Use of Corpus logos or wordmarks in product names

### Why We Make This Pledge
We believe that:
- **Protocols should be open** and free from patent fear
- **Innovation thrives** when developers can build without legal uncertainty
- **The ecosystem grows** when patents protect, not threaten, the community
- **Interoperability requires trust** – we're building bridges, not walls

Our patent portfolio exists to protect the ecosystem from patent trolls and bad actors, not to threaten implementers. This pledge ensures our patents serve their intended purpose: enabling innovation, not restricting it.

### Legal Effect
This pledge is a commitment by **Interoperable Intelligence Inc.** effective as of the date of publication. It supplements but does not replace the Apache 2.0 license or any Commercial License. For legal certainty, parties may request a signed patent non-assertion covenant from the Company.

This pledge applies only to Essential Patent Claims as defined above. All other patent rights are expressly reserved.

> **Example Scenarios:**
>
> ✅ **Protected:** You build an open-source adapter for a new vector database that implements `vector/v1` specification.
>
> ✅ **Protected:** Your company creates an internal Corpus-compatible routing service for employee use.
>
> ✅ **Protected:** A startup builds a commercial API gateway using the Corpus Protocol specifications.
>
> ✅ **Protected:** Company X and Company Y both use Corpus; X sues Y over unrelated payment processing patents.
>
> ✅ **Protected:** You implement Corpus Protocol routing and add your own proprietary features on top (the protocol implementation is protected).
>
> ⚠️ **Not Protected - Separate Analysis:** You implement Corpus Protocol (protected) and separately build an ensemble optimization algorithm that infringes our patents (not protected - separate technology).
>
> ⚠️ **Not Protected - Optional Extension:** You implement an optional extension to Corpus Protocol that wasn't in `docs/spec/` and it infringes our patents (extensions beyond specification not covered).
>
> ⚠️ **Not Protected (pledge suspended):** You sue Interoperable Intelligence Inc. for patent infringement.
>
> ⚠️ **Not Protected (pledge suspended):** You sue another Corpus implementer claiming their protocol adapter infringes your patents.
>
> ⚠️ **Not Protected:** You use "Corpus" trademarks without permission (trademark law applies separately).
>
> ⚠️ **Separate License Needed:** You want to sell a "Certified Corpus Router" using our trademarks and certification marks.
