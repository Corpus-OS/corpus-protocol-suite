**Separate Commercial and Patent License**

Separately from the Apache License, **Interoperable Intelligence Inc.** (the "Company") may offer a commercial and/or patent license (the "Commercial License") to certain users, customers, or partners.

The Commercial License is an optional, independent agreement that can grant rights **in addition to** those available under the Apache License. By way of example only, and without limitation, a Commercial License may include one or more of the following:

* **Additional patent rights** – including rights to practice certain Interoperable Intelligence Inc. patents that are not necessarily limited to "the Work" as defined in the Apache License;
* **Expanded commercialization rights** – including rights to sublicense, bundle, or resell products or services that incorporate the Software, beyond those expressly granted under the Apache License;
* **Trademark and branding rights** – including rights to use Interoperable Intelligence Inc. trademarks, service marks, certification marks, or logos (for example, for marketing, co-branding, or "powered by" designations), subject to applicable brand or usage guidelines;
* **Conformance, certification, and interoperability program benefits** – including access to conformance tooling, test suites, certification marks, interoperability badges, or similar program assets that are not provided under the Apache License;
* **Commercial terms and assurances** – including support, service-level agreements (SLAs), security or compliance commitments, indemnities, or other commercial terms not addressed by the Apache License.

The availability, scope, and specific terms of any Commercial License are determined by **Interoperable Intelligence Inc.** in its sole discretion and are set forth in a separate written agreement between you and the Company.

For the avoidance of doubt, **no Commercial License is required** to exercise any rights granted under the Apache License, and nothing in this Section limits, conditions, or modifies any rights you hold under the Apache License with respect to the Software.
