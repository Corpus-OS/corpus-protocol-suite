## What's Included in a Commercial License

The Commercial License is an optional, independent agreement that can grant rights **in addition to** those available under the Apache 2.0 License and Defensive Patent Pledge. By way of example only, and without limitation, a Commercial License may include one or more of the following:

### 1. Additional Patent Rights

**Beyond our Defensive Patent Pledge**, which covers essential patent claims, a Commercial License can provide:

- Rights to practice certain Interoperable Intelligence Inc. **non-essential patent claims** - including claims covering proprietary optimization algorithms, advanced routing strategies, and optional features not required for protocol compliance, that are not necessarily limited to "the Work" as defined in the Apache License
- Broader patent grants beyond protocol implementation
- Patent indemnification may be available subject to separate negotiation and terms

**Example:** License to non-essential patent claims covering our proprietary ensemble optimization algorithms in your commercial products.

### 2. Expanded Commercialization Rights

**Beyond the Apache 2.0 License**, a Commercial License can provide:

- Rights to sublicense, bundle, or resell products or services that incorporate the Software
- Enhanced distribution rights beyond those expressly granted under the Apache License
- Commercial partnership and integration rights

**Example:** White-label the Corpus routing engine as part of your enterprise platform offering.

### 3. Trademark and Branding Rights

Our Defensive Patent Pledge explicitly excludes trademarks. A Commercial License can provide:

- Rights to use Interoperable Intelligence Inc. trademarks, service marks, certification marks, or logos
- "Powered by Corpus" or similar marketing designations
- Co-branding opportunities
- Official vendor listing in our ecosystem directory
- Subject to applicable brand and usage guidelines

**Example:** Display "Corpus Certified Router" badge on your product marketing materials.

### 4. Conformance, Certification, and Interoperability Program Benefits

**Beyond self-testing**, a Commercial License can provide:

- Access to official conformance tooling and test suites
- Official conformance certification (Platinum/Gold/Silver tier designations)
- Use of "Corpus Certified" certification marks
- Interoperability badges and program assets
- Inclusion in official certified vendor program
- Validation and testing support

**Example:** Achieve "Corpus Platinum Certified" status with official certification mark usage rights.

### 5. Commercial Terms and Assurances

**Beyond open-source "as-is" terms**, a Commercial License can provide:

- 24/7 technical support with guaranteed response times
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
- Priority bug fixes and security patches
- Dedicated technical account management
- Custom feature development or prioritization
- Training and onboarding assistance
- Security or compliance commitments
- Indemnities or other commercial terms not addressed by the Apache License
- SOC 2 / ISO 27001 compliance documentation
- GDPR / CCPA compliance assistance

**Example:** 4-hour response time SLA for production incidents with dedicated Slack channel.

## Relationship to Apache 2.0 License

The Commercial License is **purely additive** and does not restrict any rights granted under the Apache 2.0 License.

**For the avoidance of doubt:**
- ✅ **No Commercial License is required** to exercise any rights granted under the Apache 2.0 License
- ✅ Nothing in this document limits, conditions, or modifies any rights you hold under the Apache 2.0 License with respect to the Software
- ✅ You can use, modify, and distribute the Software under Apache 2.0 regardless of whether you have a Commercial License

---

## Relationship to Defensive Patent Pledge

Interoperable Intelligence Inc. has published a **Defensive Patent Pledge** (see PATENT_PLEDGE.md) that provides non-assertion of essential patent claims to all implementers.

**The Commercial License may provide additional rights beyond the Pledge, subject to specific negotiated terms.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I sell products built with Corpus without a Commercial License?

**A:** Yes. The Apache 2.0 License explicitly permits commercial use. You can build and sell products that implement the Corpus Protocol without any Commercial License.

---

### Q: What's the difference between the Defensive Patent Pledge and a Commercial License?

**A:** 
- **Defensive Patent Pledge (Free):** Non-assertion of essential patent claims - we promise not to sue you for implementing the protocol specifications
- **Commercial License (Paid):** May provide additional rights including licenses to non-essential patent claims, trademark usage, certification, enterprise support, and potentially patent indemnification, subject to specific negotiated terms

---

### Q: Can I claim my implementation is "Corpus compatible"?

**A:** Yes, under our Defensive Patent Pledge, any implementation that passes conformance tests may state:
- ✅ "Implements Corpus Protocol v1 specification"
- ✅ "Corpus Protocol compatible"

Without authorization, you cannot claim:
- ❌ "Official Corpus implementation"
- ❌ "Corpus Certified" (requires Commercial License with certification program)

---

### Q: I only need SLA support, not patents or trademarks. Can I get just that?

**A:** Yes. Commercial Licenses are customizable. We can structure agreements with only the components you need. Contact commercial@interoperable.ai to discuss.

---

### Q: Does buying a Commercial License give me rights to the source code beyond Apache 2.0?

**A:** No. The source code rights remain Apache 2.0 regardless of Commercial License status. The Commercial License provides *additional* rights (such as patent claim licenses, trademarks, support, SLA) but doesn't change the code license.
